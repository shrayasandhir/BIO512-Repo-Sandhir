When working within a branch/creating a branch, the original code would not be affected, but it would have the same history. A fork, however, would be a copy of a document or code in a different repository. This would mean that the original was copied and could be worked on by another user separately. This would also not impact the original document but can be used when there is not full access to the original or it does not live in a repository that you have direct access to but you need to edit/utilize the code.
